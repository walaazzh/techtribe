            <p class="hero-text">
                Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an emergency
                and for people who need longterm treatments. Donating blood is a selfless act that can save lives and make a positive impact on your community.
                However, not everyone is eligible to donate blood. To ensure the safety of both donors and recipients, specific eligibility criteria must be met.<br><br>
                Remember, even if you cannot donate blood, there are other ways you can support blood donation efforts, such as encouraging eligible friends and
                family members to donate or volunteering at blood drives and donation centers.
