            <p style="font-size: larger;">Red Stream is started by the brainchild of a passionate group of engineering students polytechnic college - Govt. Polytechnic College Kaduthuruthy.
              United by a common purpose, we came together to address the pressing need for a streamlined process of blood donation so that we can use our knowledge in the field of technology
            and give a small contibution to the society from our side.</p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;">The process is straightforward: donors register their details with us, providing essential information about their blood type,
              contact details, and location. By creating a comprehensive database of donors, we can quickly match them with recipients searching for compatible donors.<br><br>
              For recipients seeking blood, our user-friendly platform allows them to enter their requirements and search for potential matches within the donor database.
              The matching process is efficient and designed to connect recipients with suitable donors promptly.<br>
            Also we provide a simple response back utility which users can enter their email address and we will directly respond from our side. Also users can pre-book blood for 
          an upcoming date and we will arrange blood directly and reach you. We also have an emergency ambulance service you can call any time.</p>
